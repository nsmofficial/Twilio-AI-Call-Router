# NextJS AI Call Center Dashboard

## Project Overview

Alright, so this thing is basically a dashboard I whipped up to simulate an AI-powered call center IVR. The main idea was for me to test how an AI would handle the initial part of a call â€“ you know, grabbing the caller's name and age, and then figuring out if that info is good enough to pass them to a human.

I used Next.js for the frontend, mostly because it's quick to get stuff up and running, and server components are pretty neat for this kind of dashboard. For the UI, it's all ShadCN components with Tailwind CSS, so it looks decent without a ton of custom styling work on my part.

The AI smarts? That's Genkit. I've got a couple of flows set up: one to pull out info like name and age from whatever text you type in (simulating a call transcript), and another to double-check if that info makes sense. Think of it like a quick sanity check before a real agent gets bothered. This part can be tested through the "AI Call Simulation" card on the dashboard.

You can punch in some sample call transcripts on the dashboard, hit a button, and see what the AI comes up with. It's all mock data for the agent statuses and call logs right now, but the AI simulation part is live (if you set up your API key!). It helped me quickly see if the prompts I'm giving the AI are actually working or if they need tweaking. Pretty handy for iterating on the AI logic without needing a full phone system hooked up.

The project also includes initial setup for Twilio integration to handle live calls.

## Tech Stack & Key Tools

*   **Framework:** Next.js (v15.3.x app router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **AI Integration:** Genkit (v1.8.x) with Google AI (Gemini models)
*   **Telephony:** Twilio (initial setup)
*   **UI:** React, ShadCN UI
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (with CSS Variables for theming)
*   **Form Handling:** React Hook Form with Zod for validation
*   **Icons:** Lucide React

## Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** v20.x or later recommended
*   **npm:** v10.x or later (or yarn v1.22.x or later)
*   **Google AI API Key (Optional for UI, Required for AI Features):**
    *   You'll need an API key from Google AI Studio (or Google Cloud Console) to use the Gemini models via Genkit for the AI Call Simulation feature.
    *   If you don't provide an API key, the dashboard will still run, but the AI simulation will be disabled and show a message.
*   **Twilio Account (Required for Twilio Integration):**
    *   A Twilio account.
    *   Your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token.
    *   A Twilio phone number.
*   **ngrok (Recommended for Local Twilio Development):**
    *   A tool to expose your local server to the internet, so Twilio can send requests to your webhook. Download from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/).

## Setup & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <project-directory-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Open the `.env` file and add your keys:
    ```env
    # For Genkit AI features
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_HERE

    # For Twilio Integration
    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID_HERE
    TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE
    # TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1YOURTWILIONUMBER # Optional, but good to have
    # TWILIO_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/twilio/voice # Optional, if you want to explicitly set for validation
    ```
    *   `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is essential for the AI simulation features. If left blank, AI simulation will be disabled.
    *   `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` are required for Twilio integration.

4.  **Run the Next.js Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

5.  **Set up Twilio Webhook (for Twilio integration):**
    *   If you're developing locally, you need to expose your local server to the internet. Install ngrok, then run:
        ```bash
        ngrok http 9002
        ```
        (Replace `9002` if your app runs on a different port). Ngrok will give you a public URL (e.g., `https://your-unique-id.ngrok.io`).
    *   Go to your Twilio console, navigate to your phone number's configuration.
    *   Under "Messaging" or "Voice & Fax", find the "A CALL COMES IN" webhook (or similar for voice).
    *   Set it to `YOUR_NGROK_URL/api/twilio/voice` (e.g., `https://your-unique-id.ngrok.io/api/twilio/voice`).
    *   Ensure the method is HTTP POST.
    *   Save the configuration.
    *   Now, when you call your Twilio number, Twilio will send a request to your local application.

6.  **Run the Genkit Development Server (Optional, for AI flow inspection, requires API Key):**
    If you want to inspect, test, or debug the Genkit flows directly using the Genkit Inspector UI (and you have set up your `GOOGLE_API_KEY`), run this command in a *separate terminal*:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    The Genkit Inspector will usually be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Building for Production

1.  **Build the Next.js application:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Start the production server:**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    For production, ensure your `TWILIO_WEBHOOK_URL` (if used for validation) and webhook configurations in Twilio point to your live application URL.
